# Customer Segmentation, EDA, and Classification

This project will be use the [Customer Segmentation Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/customer-segmentation?select=Train.csv) from Kaggle. 

The project will be split into two parts:
1. I will be analyzing and performing EDA on the dataset to discover the characteristics of each segment (A, B, C, and D) and assign descriptive labels to them. 
2. With the analysis from 1, I will then be creating a Machine Learning model to classify customers into those four segments. Then I'll be deploying the model via Streamlit. 

This is currently a work-in-progress so should you happen to arrive at this repo during the project's creation, I hope you see value in the progress I make and learn along the way with me!
